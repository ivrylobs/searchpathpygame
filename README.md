### Instructions
I included a requirements.txt for dependencies and versions. I had to use PyGame 2.0.0.dev6 because anything earlier didn't work with MacOS. 

- Run main.py
- Select grid size and search algorithm
- Select start and goal row/col Note: row/col values change based on grid size chosen
- Confirm your selection and the grid will appear
- Click and hold left mouse to add walls to the grid
- Press SPACEBAR to start the visualization
